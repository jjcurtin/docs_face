# AIMS and significance

Processing of social media data to assst in identification of mental health has gained popularity in recent years. However, despite many papers citing high performance in classification of mental health disorders as well as specific symptoms within these disorders, many approaches have lacked rigor is both outcome labelig and fair courcing of materials that limits the generalizability of findings. Moreover, it is rare for prediction papers to explore features to guide theoretical ad clinical implications of the resarcprimarily due to the nature of public platforms and the shortcomings in preprocessing and theoretical grounding. Predominantly, existing methods utilize data from public posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. These approaches are often hindered by various challenges, such as reduced accuracy due to the inherent stigma associated with sensitive topics like substance use disorders. The stigma surrounding substance use can lead individuals to avoid discussing their issues openly on public forums, thereby limiting the data available for training and validation of predictive models.

This project aims to address these limitations by developing and evaluating a machine learning algorithm specifically designed to diagnose Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) from private Facebook messages. Private messages on Facebook offer a unique advantage over public posts: they are more likely to contain candid discussions about personal issues, including substance use disorders. This increased privacy may lead to more accurate and reliable data for training models, as individuals may feel more comfortable disclosing sensitive information in a private setting.

**Specific Aims:**

1.  **Develop and Evaluate a Machine Learning Algorithm for Diagnosing AUD from Private Facebook Messages:** We will design a machine learning model tailored to analyze and classify private Facebook messages to detect signs of AUD. This approach capitalizes on the candid nature of private messaging, potentially yielding more accurate results than public posts.

2.  **Identify Top Linguistic Predictors of AUD:** We will evaluate and identify key linguistic features that distinguish messaging patterns of individuals with AUD from those without. This includes analyzing differences in the frequency and context of alcohol-related language and other relevant linguistic indicators.

3.  **Utilize LLMs and Semi-Supervised Learning to Adapt Sentiment Analysis Approaches:** We will apply large language models (LLMs) and semi-supervised learning techniques to refine existing sentiment analysis and dictionary-based approaches. The goal is to enhance the models’ ability to process and classify private message data effectively, improving the identification of significant messages and overall AUD classification accuracy.

Significance

1.  Limitations of current text analysis of social media in mental health domains

    -   Lack of clinically identified outcomes

    -   Lack of realistic variety in message types (e.g. only classifying keyword messages or positive users)

    -   Lack of theoretical expertise in designing and understanding of predictive features. Example how alorithms have significantly increased in ability to detect SI messages, but not reduce SI outcomes. Crucial to look at driving predictions and context of what we are using to predict to inform treatment and identify variability in outcome behavior

    -   Lack of reporting transparency and clear definition of outcomes. No text preprocessing guidelines

    -   Lack of combining both top down and bottom up approaches

    -   Moreover, existing models frequently suffer from problems in text preprocessing and feature extraction. For instance, inconsistencies in text preprocessing can affect the presence or absence of function words, which are critical for accurate classification and sentiment analysis. Additionally, many methods lack theoretical and clinical rigor, leading to inaccuracies and reduced reliability in detecting mental health conditions from social media data. The underrepresentation of substance use disorders, due to their sensitive nature, exacerbates these issues.

2.  Need for increased screening and insight into alcohol use disorders

    We propose to address the limitations of contemporary natural language processing of social media for mental health related outcomes via our large sample of clinically diagnosed undergraduates with and without AUD paired with data previously unused in any social media prediction of mental health outcomes – private message communications.

    Substance use disorders, particularly Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), remain significantly underrepresented in social media-based mental health research due to the stigma surrounding these issues. Traditional social media data sources often fail to capture the true scope of substance use problems because users are less likely to discuss such topics openly in public forums. This gap in data can lead to reduced classification accuracy and a lack of reliable tools for diagnosis and intervention.

3.  Match of the current project to address these limitations

    By focusing on private Facebook messages, our project aims to harness a more accurate and nuanced data source for detecting AUD. The advantages of private messages include higher rates of candid communication and a more representative sample of individuals who may otherwise refrain from disclosing sensitive information publicly. This approach will not only improve the accuracy of AUD detection but also contribute to a better understanding of linguistic markers associated with substance use disorders.

    Our project will address key shortcomings in current social media-based mental health screening methods, including the lack of theoretical grounding and rigorous validation. By developing a pipeline that combines advanced machine learning techniques with theoretical insights into language use and sentiment analysis, we aim to create a robust, clinically relevant tool for diagnosing AUD. This initiative has the potential to significantly enhance the efficacy of digital mental health interventions, providing valuable insights and early detection capabilities that can inform timely and targeted clinical interventions.

    Ultimately, this project will advance the field of social media-based mental health research by offering a more accurate and theoretically grounded approach to detecting AUD, paving the way for future studies and applications in substance use disorder diagnostics and treatment.

# Methods

## Study Overview

We have collected data from 857 undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison between May 2018 and August 2019. Students attended one hour long, in person study session during which they downloaded and provided copies of their personal Facebook profile that includes all their activity on Facebook from account inception until the day of this download (e.g., direct messages, posts, images, events, likes, groups). While their account was prepared and delivered for download, we conducedt a structured clinical interview with them to diagnosis current alcohol use disorder and a timeline follow-back interview to document episodes of binge drinking over the past 30 days. These interviews provide the two “labels” (outcomes) that we will use to train machine learning model classifiers for Aims 1 and 2 (i.e., positive vs. negative for current AUD and binge vs. no binge on each of the past thirty days).

Project analysis will focus on extraction of a high-dimensional set of predictors (e.g., \>\> 50K predictors) from their social media activity through feature engineering approaches that include natural language processing and image analysis techniques. We will train and evaluate the performance of machine learning model classifiers that use these predictors within well-established statistical learning algorithms (e.g., elastic net regularized generalized linear models, support vector machines, neural networks, random forest) to classify each student as positive or negative for AUD (AIM 1) or classify each of the past 30 days for each student as a binge vs. no binge day (AIM 2). Final model selection and evaluation for each outcome will be accomplished by nested cross validation to provide an unbiased estimate of expected model performance in “held-out” samples (i.e., new students that were not used to train these models).

## Participants

We collected data from 857 UW-Madison undergraduate students. Participants were recruited via mass email blasts to random samples of undergraduate students. The emails describe the opportunity to participate in a social media and health study and do not mention alcohol use. Prior to scheduling data collection, participants were screened to meet study inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria for all participants include: 1) Currently enrolled as an undergraduate student at UW-Madison 2) Are at least 18 years old 3) Have a Facebook account and self-report of at least some interaction (e.g., posts, messages, passive viewing of content) with account in the past month. 4) Self-report of English as primary language for communications within Facebook

Descriptive analyses from our sample demonstrate that we have a sufficient rate of AUD to train and evaluate models for AIM 1. We have documented 232 positive AUD diagnoses among our sample (27.1%) with strong interrater reliability (κ = .923, p \< .001). Only 1% of AUD positive students reported believing they had AUD prior to the in-session diagnostic interview, highlighting the inability of current efforts to inform students of their AUD risk. Equally important, were they to screen positive for AUD, 81% of our AUD positive students reported that they would be motivated to change their drinking, and 59% would consider seeking formal treatment services. This suggests that valid screening that reaches a large percentage of students with AUD could yield an important public health benefit.

Descriptive data from this preliminary sample also documents that binges are frequent and that we have a sufficient number of binges to train and evaluate models for AIM 2. With respect to binge drinking, there were 3127 binge episodes reported (12.1% of all days). Approximately 78% of students reported at least one binge episode in the past month and 40.9% of students reported 4 or more binge episodes in the past month.

## General Procedure

Students who respond to our email recruitment messages are pre-screened by phone for inclusion criteria and, if eligible, scheduled for a 1-hour visit to our laboratory. Students receive a detailed study overview, data confidentiality descriptions (e.g., local data encryption, certificate of confidentiality protections and limits), and confirm eligibility criteria before providing informed consent. Staff then guide students through downloading their Facebook. These Facebook downloads contain all social media activity for the student from account inception to date. This includes the following data sources: demographic and biographical data; interaction with ads, apps, and websites; authored and received comments, events, posts, and private messages; information about friend and follower requests, denials, and acceptances; likes and subscriptions to pages and groups; any posted photos, videos, or stories; Facebook generated profile descriptors; saved items and search history; security and login information; and lists of Facebook check ins and log in locations. Students next complete a short survey about perceptions of their AUD status and future intentions regarding treatment seeking and drinking behavior change. Following this, study staff administer the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V (SCID) and a 30-day Timeline follow-back for binge drinking, and they provide feedback to students regarding their AUD diagnosis. SCID interviews are audio recorded and reviewed by a graduate clinician to ensure interrater reliability. Before leaving, students are provided local treatment resources, debriefed, and paid \$40 for their laboratory visit. AUD positive students will be paid an additional \$10 for completing the follow-up online survey at 3 months.

## Measures

**Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID)**. The SCID is a commonly used, semi-structured interview for psychiatric diagnosis34. Study staff assess students for current AUD using Module E (for substance use disorders) of the SCID which contains 11 items assessing the DSM-5 symptoms for AUD. Students meeting any 2 of the 11 symptoms within the past 12-months are classified as positive for AUD. AUD severity can be categorized as mild (reporting 2-3 symptoms), moderate (4-5 symptoms) or severe (6 or more symptoms). Independent diagnoses are provided by a second staff member based on audio recording of the SCID to allow us to calculate inter-rater reliability for diagnoses. For AIM 1, we will train and evaluate a machine learning model to classify students as positive (2 or more symptoms) or negative for AUD. However, by collecting raw symptom level data for AUD, we will also be able to train and evaluate classifiers for ordinal AUD severity (negative, mild, moderate, or severe) or regression models for raw total symptom counts. We focus on the binary (positive vs. negative) classifier in AIM 1 because we believe that early screening for even mild AUD allows the opportunity for students to seek services or behavior change prior to more severe manifestations of the disorder.

**Timeline Followback (TLFB)**. The TLFB is a commonly used drinking assessment to obtain estimates of daily drinking within a specified time period35. This assessment has been shown to have high reliability across multiple populations of drinkers and is a useful tool when relatively precise estimates of drinking are required36. The current project uses the TLFB to assess specific instances of binge drinking (defined as consumption of 4 or more drinks within a drinking session for women or 5 or more drinks within a session for men) for each of the past 30 days. For AIM 2, we will train and evaluate a machine learning model to make temporally precise day-by-day predictions of binge vs. no binge for students.

**Alcohol Insight Questionnaire**. At the beginning of the session, participants answer a set of face valid questions regarding their beliefs about their current AUD status, their interaction with AUD screening processes to date, and perceived likelihood to take various actions if they knew they had an AUD (e.g. seeking treatment, changing drinking behaviors). We use these questions as a benchmark for current screening efforts and a measure of the potential impact of providing AUD feedback to students.
