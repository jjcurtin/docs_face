Data is stored in individual subject folders stored by their SubID (3 or 4 digit number ranging from 001 - 1047). Every subject folder should include:\n\n1.1.2.1 _SCID.wav: an audio recording of the SCID administered during the study visit (used for label validation)\nData cleaning notes:\n\nSubID 471 had a study folder and existed in our qualtrics data, but no SCID data or other data was inside of the folder.
