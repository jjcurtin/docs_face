The changes were implemented 7/12/2018. For full details on scoring, see methods &gt; Measures &gt; SCID_Scoring decisions. Briefly, we clarified cutoffs for the frequency of serious (2 or more past year) vs less serious (monthly) consequences for items 6, 7, and 9. * New SCID files are RA corrections to their qualtrics reported SCID scores.
